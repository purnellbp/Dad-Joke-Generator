## Features in Detail

### Dynamic OpenGraph Images

The application generates dynamic OpenGraph images for social sharing. When a joke is generated, the URL updates with the joke text, and the OpenGraph image includes the current joke. This creates a better sharing experience on social media platforms.

#### Previewing OpenGraph Images

You can preview how your OpenGraph images will look in several ways:

1. **Direct URL Access**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/opengraph-image?joke=Your joke text here
   ```
   This will show you exactly how the image will appear when shared.

2. **Social Media Preview Tools**:
   - Use [OpenGraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/) - paste your URL to see how it appears on different platforms
   - Use [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
   - Use [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)

3. **Vercel Deployment**:
   - After deploying to Vercel, use the built-in OpenGraph Image Preview in your deployment dashboard
   - Each deployment will show you a preview of your OpenGraph images in the "OpenGraph" tab

4. **Local Development**:
   - Generate a joke on the homepage
   - The URL will update with the joke parameter
   - Visit `/opengraph-image` with that URL to see the generated image

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented using Redis (locally) or Vercel KV (in production) to prevent abuse. The limits are configurable through environment variables:
- `RATE_LIMIT_DURATION`: Duration of the rate limit window in seconds
- `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW`: Maximum number of requests allowed per window

### Analytics

Google Tag Manager is integrated to track:
- Page views
- Joke generations
- Social shares
- User interactions
