# Dad Joke Generator 👨

> _Because the world needs more groan-worthy jokes, obviously._

Welcome to **Dad Joke Generator** — the absolute pinnacle of modern technology dedicated to making you roll your eyes and sigh deeply. Yes, we decided that the universe didn’t have enough cheesy jokes, so we built a **Next.js 15** masterpiece with **TypeScript** and **Shadcn UI** to flood your life with an endless supply of puns no one asked for.

## Features

Oh, boy. Where do we even begin?

1. **Random Dad Joke Generation**: Because the best things in life are random…like your uncle’s unprompted stories at family reunions.
2. **AI-Powered Jokes (OpenAI)**: We taught an advanced neural network to craft puns your dad would be proud of. Finally, AI is being used for something truly important.
3. **Dynamic Background Images (Unsplash)**: Because static backgrounds are so _five minutes ago_. Enjoy a slideshow of free stock images that’s guaranteed to keep your eyeballs from falling asleep.
4. **Shadcn UI**: A modern UI kit that screams “I’m a pro developer!” even if all you did was run `npm install`.
5. **Smooth Animations (Framer Motion)**: Watch jokes fade in and out with elegance…unlike your patience during dad jokes.
6. **Responsive Design**: So you can cringe at corny jokes on any device, anytime, anywhere.
7. **Light/Dark Mode**: For when you want to tell dad jokes at midnight but don’t want to blind yourself with a bright screen.
8. **Smart Caching for Backgrounds**: Because refreshing the same backgrounds for new jokes is a bigger waste of resources than a Dad Joke Marathon on cable TV.
9. **Local Storage for Tracking Viewed Jokes**: You’ll never have to see the same joke twice… unless you actually want to, which is a weird thing to want.
10. **Social Sharing**: It’s time to become the friend your social circle politely avoids by sharing dad jokes with them all day, every day.

## Live Demo

Because you can’t truly appreciate our questionable brand of humor until you experience it in real-time, we’ve deployed a live version of this wonder at:

Take a deep breath, prepare to cringe, and click with caution.

## Getting Started

Because we know you’re itching to get your very own Dad Joke Generator up and running (truly, what a highlight of your day), here’s how you do it:

1. **Clone This Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dad-joke-generator.git
   cd dad-joke-generator
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or use `yarn` if you prefer to feel superior.
3. **Run Development Server**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy the wave of cringe that awaits you.

## Scripts

- **`npm run dev`**: Fires up that blazing-fast development server nobody asked for.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production, because apparently “production-ready dad jokes” is a real thing now.
- **`npm run start`**: Runs the built app, so you can share your jokes with the unfortunate souls around you.
- **`npm run lint`**: Ensures your code is as squeaky clean as the jokes are not.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15**: Because we couldn’t resist the bleeding edge (and the occasional papercut).
- **TypeScript**: For type safety so secure, you’ll feel safer than a toddler wearing floaties in a kiddie pool.
- **Shadcn UI**: Because having a stylish UI somehow makes dad jokes more bearable.
- **Framer Motion**: To animate your transition from delight to despair when hearing the next pun.
- **OpenAI**: Training an advanced AI to replicate Dad’s comedic timing—what could go wrong?
